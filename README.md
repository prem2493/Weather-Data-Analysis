# Weather-Data-Analysis
This project utilizes R programming for the analysis of historical weather data in Delhi, with a focus on temperature trends and precipitation prediction. This project employs various libraries such as dplyr for data manipulation ; ggplot2 for data visualization and time series analysis, and also Metrics, caTools libraries for data modeling.

The analysis includes exploration of yearly temperature averages and maximums, identification of extreme monthly temperatures, comparison of temperature series for different years.

This includes the development of a linear regression model for precipitation prediction. Loading additional weather data from 'IndianWeather.csv.'. Preprocessing the data by extracting year, month, and day information. 
Encoding the categorical data for better prediction.Splitting the data into training and testing sets. Building a linear regression model to predict precipitation based on various weather parameters. Evaluating the model's performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Visualizing the original precipitation values and the predicted values for comparison of test-data set
